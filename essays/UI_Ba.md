Attempting the WOD for the first time was fairly difficult. I opened the assignment, not knowing what to expect, and was really confused on how to even start. My first piece of advice? Read through the instructions before you begin. The whole thing. Then think back on what you learned during the reading, for me it’s difficult to learn just by reading a text so it helped me to just try the WOD. Once I attempted WOD 1 to the best of my ability, I tried to find the answers within the assigned readings instead of watching the screencast. By doing this, it helped to associate which readings were being tested in the WOD, for example, how to give an Id to an item such as “Introduction,” “Internet Explorer,” etc. I attempted the WOD again and still wasn’t able to complete it within the time, I took about 25 minutes the second time though, whereas my first attempt was around 36 minutes. After attempting to learn it by myself, I watched the screencast and followed along as it played. The next attempt took me 13 minutes, and I felt proud. 
	WOD 2 was a lot easier, as I had grasped the basic concept of it, however, it was still challenging to correctly add the formats into style.css for the first time. I repeated my learning process again and it took me 4 attempts to get it. WOD 3 took me a little bit longer since I kind of forgot what I learned so I had to review the readings again before I began. Overall, I recommend doing the readings and trying to take notes as you read. I will definitely practice these again on my own to review and make sure I retain the information.
