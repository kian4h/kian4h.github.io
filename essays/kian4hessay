*It's not that deep*

Think of a time you were embarrassed. Ok. Now think of a time someone else was embarrassed. Much harder right? And it hit me. You know what it never was? That deep.

## Here is the power in changing your thinking

As college students, we face many struggles. Struggles related to school, relationships, wealth, and our future. As a student myself, I've found myself constantly complaining about how difficult life is and how badly I wanted college to be over. 

I'm sure many of you have felt the same at some point, whether it be during your exams or at sports practice, the feeling of wanting it to end has probably occurred. 

This is such a sad way to live life. Longing for the future instead of living in the moment. Life will pass you by if you continue this way of thinking. 

## Negative perspectives limits potential.

According to Mental Health Therapist, Alejandra Luna, people who practice negative self-talk experience higher levels of stress. This is true because if you constantly have your #1 hater telling you negative things all the time in your head, you will have a very stressful life.

You’re affirming negative thinking with negative outcomes. When you berate yourself and put yourself down before even trying, it can take away the potential opportunities that would have been yours.

   For example, you might tell yourself that there is no point in preparing for an upcoming interview because you believe you don’t deserve it. Then when you don’t get the job, you think to yourself, “See, this always happens. I wasn’t going to get it anyway.” This is letting your mindset kill your dreams before they can blossom.

## The root of this way of thinking is your past interactions and how you subconsciously incorporate it into your daily life.

 According to the Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science, Relational Frame Theory is the process of learning identity through your repeated actions. Basically, how you develop your concept of “I” or self.

Over the course of your life, your habits develop and change over time. However, we are at a time in our lives where our habits will define the course of the rest of our life. We can start a positive change by altering the way we think and view ourselves. View yourself as a successful person and incorporate the habits you believe contribute to success. Staying disciplined to these habits, disregarding how you feel about it in that moment, will bring you a greater life than you could ever imagine.
